    b. mmWave mask
    c. outlier removal
    d. add noise to xyz
    (with pictures display)

2. full reconstruction (with demonstration)
3. cost to solve the density problem (possible pictures)
 
Evaluation
results on synthetic datasets + real mito dataset (Qualitive Pictures + Quantitive Table)

Discussion
Comparison in latent space, PCA -> map each cluster into different places
